AND NOW ABOUT ......     

Are you bored to use the standard hints ? Wish to put more informations there ? Maybe some pictures ?
Then all what you have to do is to use my component . 
Is very...very easy to use . But I put anyway all informations about it .

First type in FormCreate procedure next line :

HintWindowClass:=TgnHint;

Then play with properties .

BACKGROUND : - Color_Start and Color_End set the start and the end colors for gradient background. In case that you don't use a gradient or a picture , the Color_Start is used to paint the background .
             - Fill_Direction set the gradient direction paint ( left, right,up and down ).
             - Gradient - have or not gradient .
             - Picture - set the desire picture for background .
             - Picture_Arrange : tile , stretch , center the picture . If is set to None the picture isn't used .
             - Transparence - set the transparence of the hint , of course .


BORDER : - Bevel - set raised or lower bevels for border.
         - Bordered - set if the border is displayed or not .
         - Color_Frame , Color_Hight and Color_Low set the border colors .
         - Frame_Size set the frame breadth .
         - Picture - set the picture for the border frame ;
         - Picture_Show - the border use or not the picture .

FONT,NAME,TAG - standard properties :)

HIDEPAUSE - who long the hint is displayed .

PAUSE - how mush I must wait until the hint is displayed.

PICTURE - the picture displayed on top-left of the hint . If is assigned is allways displayed .

To use different hints for different things use in FormCreate procedure:

Application.OnShowHint := ShowHint;

Then create ShowHint procedure:

procedure ShowHint(var HintStr: string; var CanShow: Boolean; var HintInfo: THintInfo);
.......... 
procedure TForm1.ShowHint(var HintStr: string; var CanShow: Boolean;
  var HintInfo: THintInfo);
begin
  With HintInfo do
  begin
    if HintControl = Label1 then
    begin
     ................
    end;
    if HintControl = Edit5 then
    begin
     ............
    end;
    ...............
end;


For moment this is all . See you on next 'version' .

P.S. This trial version work only under Delphi's IDE .
