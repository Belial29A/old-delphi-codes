CoolTrayIcon, ver. 3.0.0


- ver. 3.0.0: CoolTrayIcon is now distributed together with the 
  new TextTrayIcon component. New method: BitmapToIcon which 
  renders an icon from a bitmap. Bug fixed: app. was displayed on 
  the taskbar even though StartMinimized was true if the main form 
  was an MDI form. Updated the documentation.

- ver. 2.5.1: Fixed the bug that required the main form to have 
  focus in order to determine keyboard status in the OnMouseDown, 
  OnMouseUp, and OnMouseMove events.

- ver. 2.5.0: Added support for "balloon hint". This feature is 
  implemented in WinMe, Win2000 and WinXP only. Invoking the balloon 
  hint in other Windows versions method will not have any effect.

- ver. 2.4.1: Fixed a bug that sometimes caused a stack overflow 
  as a graphic method repeatedly called itself. Thanks to Nihat 
  Yorganzi and others. Improved the demo so the "Close to tray" 
  option will not prevent Windows from shutting down.

- ver. 2.4.0: Added a little trick suggested by Damien Honeyford: 
  When the Explorer crashes, the all too familiar result is that 
  all tray icons disappear. CoolTrayIcon will now intercept the 
  taskbar re-creation message, and automatically re-display the 
  tray icon. This feature will only work with Win98 and above or 
  Internet Explorer 4 and above. Other things: Documentation is now 
  in HTML. Added another icon animation to the demo.

- ver. 2.3.0: Various minor bugs fixed: 1) Calling the ShowMainForm 
  and HideMainForm methods before the main form was created would 
  crash the app. Fixed thanks to James Legg. 2) The tooltip would 
  give trouble if it was 64 chars. Thanks to Toms Baugis and 
  Teus de Jong. 3) The popup menu would not close itself auto-
  matically if the StartMinimized property was true. Thanks to 
  Ingo Krueger, Chris Witt, and Reister HansJoerg.

- ver. 2.2.2: When there was more than one form visible the 
  taskbar icon would not hide when the main form was minimized.
  Fixed.

- ver. 2.2.1: Fixed a popup menu bug. Also fixed a bug which meant 
  D2 and D3 users could not compile the component. Added more icon 
  animations in the demo. Thanks to Daniele Gervasoni for the 
  "tray graph".

- ver. 2.2.0: IconIndex is now a property, allowing you to specify 
  an icon at run-time. The OnCycle event is changed so it returns 
  the index to the next icon that will display when cycling.
  Finally, I fixed a bug that caused the taskbar icon not to 
  display itself when MinimizeToTray was true. Thanks to Lorenz 
  Graf for pointing it out to me.

- ver. 2.1.4: The main form will no longer show itself untimely 
  after the form's BorderStyle property is changed. Thanks to 
  Thomas Reimann.

- ver. 2.1.3: Fixed a bug that caused the main form not to display 
  itself (how embarassing). 

- ver. 2.1.2: I *finally* found the bug that would cause some 
  compound controls (like controls on notebook pages or tab 
  sheets) not to display properly when StartMinimized was true.
  Incidently, this also means that TForm.Position now works.
  Also fixed a minor bug that caused modal forms owned by the 
  main form to appear behind the main form when the popup menu 
  appeared (thanks to Arash Ramin).

- ver. 2.1.1: Added notification method to properly detect whether 
  the associated popup menu and imagelist are deleted. Thanks to 
  Hui Jin Ong for pointing it out to me and making suggestions.

- ver. 2.1.0: Added property MinimizeToTray. This was done by 
  hooking into the application's message processing.

- ver. 2.0.0: Name is now TCoolTrayIcon. Added icon cycling and 
  design preview capabilities. Added method Refresh. Fixed a bug 
  that caused some controls to not redraw when starting your app. 
  as invisible.

- ver. 1.0.3: Added property Enabled. Also fixed a bug reported by 
  David Knaack, which caused a runtime error if you double-clicked 
  when no popup menu was assigned to the icon.

- ver. 1.0.2: Added a Handle property, and enabled handling of 
  default menu items. (Partially) fixed a bug so the icon will 
  update itself when a new icon is assigned.

- ver. 1.0.1: The associated popup menu now behaves as it is 
  supposed to. Also fixed that forms using the tray icon didn't 
  go in front of other windows when restored. Thanks to Chris Hope 
  for telling me.

- ver. 1.0.0: First release. Component was called TTrayIcon at 
  the time.



If you have any comments or corrections, I would very much like to 
hear them. If you develop some cool tray animations you want to 
share, send them to me  :-)
