To run the exe demo you must have the Delphi started .

Install info :

Put a copy of dll in Windows\System folder . Then install the gnWater.dpk .
Don't forget to add path for this package ( Tools - Environment Options -
Library - Library Path ).
Thats all .

How to use:

Drop it in your form and set a picture .
For best quality and real time effects I have limited the image size to maximum 320x240 .

DROP property :
DROP water in your image . Set the SIZE of drop , the range of DISPERSION , and the point of 
dropping ( LEFT and TOP ) . Then just gnwater1.DROPPED .

WAVE property :

Here you can set the REFLECTION , the SIZE , the range of DISPERSION and the INTENSITY of wave .
This effect start himself ( you don't need to start it ) . If you wish to stop the animation 
use gnWater1.Fine . To restart use gnWater1.Start .


VERY IMPORTANT . Free the component onDestroy and stop the animation ( gnwater.Fine )
before close ( OnClose ).

Price : 25$

I don't test it , but I think that the Dll must work with any compiler .
