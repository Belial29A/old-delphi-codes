This demo shows an easy way to create a program that can store a bunch of files within itself at runtime...
You can then 'finalize' the exe and it will convert itself into a program that will extract all the files you stored...and then run the first file that you saved inside the exe.
This first file can be any file that windows recognizes.. an exe,html,pdf,zip,jpg...etc.

You can easily add compression to this program and then you will have a nice self extracting archive program... use it for storing web pages, ebooks, images... or create a self extracting setup program like wise install.. there are a lot of uses for a simple program like this one :-)

You can double-click on a blank part of the form to reset the program back to its original state, this removes all the files from the exe..so you can start over :-)


Please read the comments in ExeMod.pas .. especially if you use NT/2000/XP
