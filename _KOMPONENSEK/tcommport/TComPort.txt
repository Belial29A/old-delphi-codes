TComPort is a component that encapsulates Win API serial
communication. Serial communication programming is one
of the most difficult and not very well documented area
in windows programming. Use of TComPort component makes
serial communication programming very easy. No knowledge
of Win API needed.

-------------------------------------------------------

1. Properties

1.1. BaudRate
  Baud rate is a speed at which computer communicates
with a serial device. 

1.2. DataBits
  Number of data bits sent in one step. This is usually
set to 8 bits.

1.3. EnableDTR
  If EnableDTR is set to true, the computer raises DTR
signal (data terminal ready) when com port is opened.
This should be set to true when communicating with modem.

1.4. Events
  Set of events that serial device driver will monitor.
Selecting only used events could gain some performance
improvement.

1.5. Parity
  Set parity to desired value to check for data errors.

1.6. Port
  Com port number: 1, 2, 3 or 4.

1.7. StopBits
  Number of stop bits that are sent or recieved after 
data bits have arrived.

1.8. ReadBufSize
  Size of the input buffer.

1.9. WriteBufSize
  Size of the ouput buffer.

1.10. FlowControl
  FlowControl is type of control for buffer overflow checking.

BaudRate, DataBits, StopBits, Parity, FlowControl should be
synchronized with a serial device parameters.


2. Events

2.1. OnOpen
  OnOpen is triggered when com port is succesfully opened with
Open method

2.2. OnClose
  OnClose is triggered when com port is closed.

2.3. OnRxChar
  This is the most used event. It is launched when a charachter(s)
arrives in input buffer. InQue parameter is number of bytes 
waiting in the input buffer.

2.4. OnRxFlag.
  OnRxChar is triggered when event charachter arrives.

2.5. OnTxEmpty.
  OnTxEmpty is Launched when ouput buffer is flushed.

2.6. OnCTS, OnDSR, OnRLSD
  These events detect a change on CTS, DSR, RLSD signals.

2.7. OnRing
  OnRing is triggered when a ring signal is detected. Used only
  with modems.

2.8. OnError
  OnError is triggered when a line error ocurs.

2.9. OnBreak
  OnBreak is triggered when a line break is detected. Input and
output is suspended until break is cleared.


3. Methods.

3.1. procedure Open;
  Open method opens com port

3.2. procedure Close;
  Close method closes com port

3.3. function Write(var Buffer; Count: Integer): Integer;
  Write method writes to com port ouput buffer. Buffer is data, which
will be send to output buffer. Count is a number of bytes that will be
send. Return value is number of actually written bytes.

3.4. function WriteString(Str: String): Integer;
  Similar to Write, but it sends a string to ouput buffer.

3.5. function Read(var Buffer; Count: Integer): Integer;
  Read method reads Count number of bytes and writes them do Buffer
variable. Return value is number of actually read bytes.

3.6. function ReadString(var Str: String; Count: Integer): Integer;
  Similar to Read, but bytes are read into a variable of type String

3.7. procedure PurgeIn;
  PurgeIn clears input buffer and stops all input functions.

3.8. procedure PurgeOut;
  PurgeOut clears ouput buffer and stops all ouput functions

3.9. function InQue: Integer;
  InQue method returns number of bytes waiting in input buffer.

3.10. function OutQue: Integer;
  OutQue method returns number of bytes waiting in ouput buffer
for transmission.

3.11 procedure ActiveCTS/DSR/RLSD;
  These methods return the state of CTS/DSR/RLSD signals.
True for high state and False for Low state.

3.12. function GetComHandle: THandle;
  GetComHandle returns com port handle.
