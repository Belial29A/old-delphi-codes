Merry Christmas! This demo can make every day feel like Christmas
on your PC. The demo renders a snowy landscape, complete with
falling snowflakes, a starry sky, some moving clouds, pine trees,
a moon, and some twinkling stars every now and then.
On the OpenGL side of things, the program uses display lists,
texture objects, alpha testing and billboard textures. Moreover,
the snowflakes and twinkling stars are done using a flexible
particle system engine, which is in fact a cut-down version of
the one I'm using in my 3D engine, Untitled-3D. For more
information on Untitled-3D, visit the projects page on my site:
  www.gamedeveloper.org/delphi3d/projects.shtml
On this page, you can find links to some screenshots that show the
full version of the particle engine being used for fog and
explosions.
Enjoy the holidays, and don't give in to the Y2K hype :-)
